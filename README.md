# libft_decoded
Visual Metaphors for Code, Part 1: Libft. An artistic exploration of C programming fundamentals.

This project is the first part of my "Visual Metaphors for Code" series. 
It centers on Libft, the foundational École 42 project that challenges students to recreate standard C library functions from scratch. 
This project isn't just an implementation of a standard library—it's a visual investigation into its core concepts. My objective is to push beyond writing code to translate abstract logic into a universal visual language. Here, I deconstruct basic ideas like strings, memory, and linked lists to find and reveal their inner structure and hidden elegance.



## Gallery of Concepts

Here are some of the concepts from the `libft` library, deconstructed and reinterpreted as visual ideas.
